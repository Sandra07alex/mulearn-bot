<h1>Discord Bot Implementation</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

Your implementation should be well-structured, efficient, and maintainable. Consider
utilizing best practices and implementing error handling where necessary. Provide a
GitHub repository link that contains your project files and code. Ensure the repository is
publicly accessible. This project implements a Discord bot using the Discord.py library
to perform various tasks on a Discord server.


1. Welcome Card Implementation: Sends a welcome message in a specific channel
and initiates a direct message to new members joining the server.

2. Word Counting: Counts all words sent by a user, stores the data in the
database, and displays it using commands.

3. User Role Selection Implementation: Implement a slash command which sends
a select menu, displaying available roles for users to choose from. Once a role is
selected, it is assigned to the user and the role details are stored in the database.


The implementation follows best practices, utilizes error handling, and aims for
efficiency and maintainability.
